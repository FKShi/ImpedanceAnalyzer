# Impedance Analyzer

The impedance analysis toolkit aims to provide open source tools for the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data. *These tools are currently under development and contributions, suggestions, and feedback are really appreciated!* (contact: mmurbach `at` uw `dot` edu)

This repository contains all of the code for the [Impedance Analyzer](http://impedance-analyzer-env.x3enj2mmuk.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/index) currently running using Elastic Beanstalk on Amazon Web Services.
