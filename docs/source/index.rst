==============================================
Welcome to Impedance Analyzer's documentation!
==============================================

Impedance Analyzer is an open-source, web-based analysis platform aimed at making
physics-based models as easy to use as equivalent circuits for quantitative analysis of EIS experimental data.

The tool is currently hosted here: http://theimpedanceanalyzer.com

It should be noted that the ImpedanceAnalyzer is currently a beta release.
Improved documentation, tests, features, and an improved dataset are upcoming in the v1.0.0 release.
